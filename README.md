-The cinema e-booking back-end is a combination of ASGI and WSGI configurations. Both are for asynchronous and synchronous server communication, respectively. For data storage, MySQL is utilized with settings located in settings.py. Key components include core Django apps, custom apps (like v1 and authentication), and other libraries like rest_framework and corsheaders. The server is set up for SMTP email notifications via Gmail, and CORS is enabled to allow all origins-always an advantage for cross-domain requests in development. 

-URL routing in urls.py covers two main areas: the Django admin interface and API endpoints at v1 for core functionality and authentication routes. The middleware integrates security, session management, and cross-origin request handling; while the REST API, built with Django REST Framework, provides a security layer in the form of token-based authentication access. Static files are served from their respective static/directory, and manage.py provides command-line utilities for server management, database migrations, and other management functions. The API provides a common structure for user management, like registration, login, email verification, profile updates, and password resets. 

-Some methods like register tirelessly wait for new user accounts, email verification, and login to allow legitimate users and issue tokens for secure communication. The functionalities also go ahead to include profile management, resetting password, exacting email verification, and checking for email existence. The create_admin view suggests the possibility for admin management functionality. To validate, the test.rest file provides sample API requests used for login, registration, token verification, and admin creation functionalities.

-The SQL schema outlines the tables that are foundational to support e-booking, such as the Account State, User, Admin, Customer, Movie, Showroom, Showtime, Booking Promotion, Payment Card, Ticket Type, and Ticket: this will essentially be handling user accounts, showtime management, booking records, and the processing of payments in totality.
